# ðŸ“Ž Paperclip
A PHP CLI tool to manage custom commands.

# Creating commands
From the root of your project you can add Commands however you like.
The default structure is classes/Commands/... (in composer: NAMESPACE/Commands/...)

Make the new command be a child of the `Command.php` class and register this in the
`paperclip.commands.json` file in the root of your project.

Example:
```json
[
  'NAMESPACE/Commands/ExampleCommand'
]
```
